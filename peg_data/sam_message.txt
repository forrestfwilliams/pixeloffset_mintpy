Re: Survey Peg Movement_Analysis_November2020.xlsx

Attached are the GPS data for the Rangitikei Pegs in Excel file. The excel file is rather complicated, but if you use the fourth sheet labelled as 'Movement graphs v2' you can query the sheet for any pegs in the landslide you want data for. To do so follow the instructions, but essentially you replace the number in the green cell (L5) with the peg number of interest (e.g. peg 1), and then you can copy the results (from top block of pink cells) for each peg. The only tricky thing is when there are data missing from one or more dates (shown as 'null' in the summary table starting in cell O8). In that situation you have to adjust the pink rows in lines 9-22, by copy and pasting to move the pink cells up. If it is the earliest date (bottom row) that has data missing, then just delete the data in columns G-L for that row. To reinstate the pink cells again for each new query (if you have adjusted the pink cells), copy and paste from the master block.

Instructions: To get a graph for a survey peg, enter survey mark exact name into the GREEN cell below. You can edit the top block of results to adjust the graph for missing data shown as null in table below right. Do that by copy and pasting pink rows belw to move them up to overwrite a null row). Afterwards reinstate the top block by copying from the master block
